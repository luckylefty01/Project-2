For my second project I created a collectible store to buy items from various Comic Cons. I've regularly attended these events and purchased various collectibles myself, I also take pictures of my own collectibles and post them on my social media. One thing I have done through Facebook and ebay is sell collectibles that I have in bulk or those I no longer want to own as I collect newer ones. 

Here are some issues I ran into while building this project out:

1. After styling my edit page, nodemon was showing me an error in my show.ejs file line 15  in code <%=comic.name%> it cannot read property name of undefined. Due to this my edit page is not styled. The pages all function. Aj and Evan assisted me in a bug hunt but everything looks in order and I was not able to find the error.
2. I did minimal CSS styling to my project. In the future I plan to add Bootstrap to assist with my page layouts.
3. I had issues with setting up authorization so I scrapped it, the code is still in the server.js file. I also have the folders and files(sessions & users) in the views folder. I plan to add this functionality when I have time to in the future.
4. I wanted a shopping cart feature and I found a video with how to do build it out, I just ran out of time to start developing it. This feature will be added with the authorization in the future. 

Lastly I want to thank AJ, Banu, Evan, and Brandon for helping me with issues I ran into afterhours.
